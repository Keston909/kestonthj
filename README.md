The Heroes Journey compatible UI

By Keston909 (Discord)

# Notes
# I based this UI compilation off of Sparxx from EQinterface.com and other amazing pieces I have found over the years.  It was difficult to find an ROF2 compatible version and then had to recode some parts to fit THJ multiclass standard.
# Future proofed it in case of stat inflation
# Special thanks to Arkk for all the edits and updates he's managed on it also!
# This UI is best used in 1920x1080 Resolution but may work in others, you'll have to mess with it to find out.
# Original live version can be found here.  https://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=4620
